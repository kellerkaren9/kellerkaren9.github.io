During the experience of coding my resume, I learned both HTML and CSS for web design. In HTML I determined the content and general order of my various qualifying sections, including Employment, Education, and Skills. In CSS, I implemented a style system of typographic, color sheme, and general design elements.

My biggest successes in this project were achieving an aesthetic which reflects my personality and artistic preferences, including an image of one of my own paintings as the background. However, I did struggle with CSS Grid and text and div overflow. Although I tweaked many elements of my CSS files, I could not fix the footer overflow. I luckily was able to contain all of my other sections in the appropriate blocks with some edits.
